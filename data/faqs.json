    "keywords": ["git", "branching", "workflow", "version control"]
  },
  {
    "question": "How do we handle code reviews?",

    "keywords": ["pull request", "github", "workflow", "collaboration"]
  },
  {
    "question": "What's the sprint workflow?",
    "answer": "Each sprint starts with planning where we select tasks from the backlog. During the sprint, work on assigned tasks, attend daily standups, and update task status. End with a sprint review to demo completed work and a retrospective to improve processes.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What's the definition of done?",
    "answer": "A task is done when code is written and tested, all tests pass, code is reviewed and approved, documentation is updated, and changes are merged to develop. The feature must work in the preview environment without errors.",

  },
  {
    "question": "How do I give effective code review feedback?",

    "category": "Module 2",
    "keywords": ["code review", "feedback", "collaboration", "communication"]
  },
  {
    "question": "How do we handle environment variables?",

  {
    "question": "What's the database migration strategy?",
    "answer": "All database changes must go through migrations stored in the /migrations folder. Test migrations locally first, then in staging. Never modify existing migrations that have been deployed. Always include both up and down migrations for reversibility.",

  },
  {
    "question": "How do I implement proper error handling?",
